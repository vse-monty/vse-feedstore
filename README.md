# VSE FEED STORE

> WIP

This APP is developed to send Visionary Sales Environments 'Orders' to the corresponding Adobe CEP Panels.

#SETUP

Will need the 2 panels located at:
github.com/vse-monty/vse-server
github.com/vse-monty/vse-eatery

Create a symbolic link to, or install directly in the [USER]/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extentions/ folder

clone this project and yarn or npm install.

>quasar dev -m electron

not all functions will work outside of electron mode
illustrator and panels will need to be open for all functionality to work as intended.
